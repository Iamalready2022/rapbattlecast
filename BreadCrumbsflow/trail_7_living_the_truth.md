# Trail 7: The Lion's Kingdom (Living the Truth)

> *"The Kingdom of God is within you."* — Luke 17:21

## 1. The Rhyming Tale: The Lion in the Street

The noise of the city is loud and it’s fast,
A whirlwind of shadows from your own heavy past.
The news on the screen and the talk on the phone,
Are trying to tell you you’re small and alone.
But you walk with a rhythm that they can’t explain,
A Lion who’s liberated, a King without chain.
You don’t look for safety in the bank or the crowd,
You carry the Silence, you carry it proud.

A Lion doesn’t ask for the sheep to agree,
He doesn't need "them" to decide he is free.
His Kingdom is internal, his borders are deep,
He’s wide awake while the rest of them sleep.
He knows that the world is a mirror, a toy,
A playground for Wisdom, a vessel for Joy.
If the mirror is ugly, he doesn't complain,
He changes the **Above** and he breaks the old strain.

You are the Law-Giver, you are the Priest,
The host of the banquet, the king of the feast.
The truth isn't something you "find" in a book,
It’s the authority found in the way that you look at the world.
Hold to the vision, hold to the light,
Day after day, through the depth of the night.
The Kingdom is here, and the Kingdom is now,
The crown is already fixed on your brow.

## 2. The Bread Crumbs

*   **The Kingdom Within (Luke 17:21):** Jesus famously stated that the Kingdom of God isn't "Lo here!" or "Lo there!"—it is *within you*. This is the ultimate bread crumb. It means the source of all supply, security, power, and identity is an internal state. To "enter" the kingdom, you don't go anywhere; you simply change your awareness.
*   **Persistence (Neville Goddard):** Neville taught that "Persistence" is the master virtue. The physical world (the "shadow") is slow to change. If you assume the feeling of your wish tonight, but tomorrow morning you react to your "empty bank account" or your "lonely room," you have "stepped out" of your kingdom. **Bread Crumb:** You must stay in the state until the shadow is forced to catch up.
*   **Being the Law-Giver:** In your own mind, *your* word is the only law. If you decree "I am healthy," but then spend the day telling people "I feel terrible," you are issuing conflicting laws. A King doesn't argue with his subjects; he simply decrees. **Bread Crumb:** Stop being a "reactor" to circumstances and start being the "Creator" of them.
*   **The Master’s Presence:** Authentic awakening isn't about being peaceful in a cave. It’s about being peaceful in a traffic jam. It’s about holding the "I AM" awareness while you are washing the dishes or talking to a difficult boss. **Bread Crumb:** The purpose of the clues is to make the "mystical" into the "mundane."

## 3. Contemplative Questions

1.  Am I currently a "Subject" in someone else's kingdom (reacting to their moods, their news, their rules)?
2.  What is the "First Decree" I want to issue for my life today?
3.  If "The Feeling is the Secret," what is the feeling I am currently wearing? Does it look like a King’s robe or a beggar’s rags?
4.  Can I walk through a challenging situation today while secretly holding the "Silence" of Trail 1?
5.  What area of my life am I still hoping will change "out there" before I change it "in here"?

## 5. The Exercise: The Morning Decree

**Goal:** To establish your Kingdom before the "world" has a chance to tell you who you are.

1.  **The Two-Minute Window:** As soon as you wake up—*before* you touch your phone, before you get out of bed—stay still.
2.  **The State:** Choose the "State" you want to live in today (e.g., Abundance, Health, Clarity, Influence).
3.  **The Decree:** In the first person, speak your decree for the day. (e.g., *"Today, I walk in the favor of the Most High. Every person I meet is a messenger of my good. I provide value, and value flows to me. I AM the law of my world."*)
4.  **The Feeling:** Feel the weight of the crown. Feel the authority in your chest. Breathe it in for 60 seconds.
5.  **The Integration:** When you finally get out of bed, step onto the floor as a King/Queen entering their court. Carry that specific "feeling" into your first cup of coffee or your first conversation.
